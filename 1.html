    Humility turns a man into an angel, but pride turns a man into a devil.
    Arrogance is the root of all sin, and vanity is the greatest obstacle to fellowship.
    Give your reputation to your neighbors and take responsibility to yourself.
    It is truly shameful not to know shame.
    The closer you get to material desires, the more impoverished your soul becomes.
    Complete abstinence is easier than moderate abstinence.
    Because we are human, we may make mistakes, but not correcting them even when we know they are mistakes is evidence of weakness.

    I do not believe it even though it is unreasonable; I believe it precisely because it is unreasonable.
    An unjust law is not a law.
    Without justice, wouldn't power be nothing more than robbery?
    Confession of evil deeds is the beginning of good deeds.
